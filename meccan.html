    <h1>EARLY LIFE OF THE PROPHET</h1>
    <p>Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim[39] was born in Mecca[40] about the year 570,[1] and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal.[41] He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, which was a dominant force in western Arabia.[42] While his clan was one of the more distinguished in the tribe, it seems to have experienced a lack of prosperity during his early years.[12][d] According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad was a hanif, someone who professed monotheism in pre-Islamic Arabia. He is also claimed to have been a descendant of Ishmael, son of Abraham.[43][citation not found][44]   </p>
    <p>The name Muhammad means "praiseworthy" in Arabic and it appears four times in the Quran.[45] He was also known as al-Amin (lit. 'faithful') when he was young; however, historians differ as to whether it was given by people as a reflection of his nature[46] or was simply a given name from his parents, i.e., a masculine form of his mother's name "Amina".[47] Muhammad acquired the kunya of Abu al-Qasim later in his life after the birth of his son Qasim, who died two years afterwards.[48]    </p>

    Islamic tradition states that Muhammad's birth year coincided with the Year of the Elephant, when Abraha, the Aksumite viceroy in the former Himyarite kingdom, unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Mecca.[49] Recent studies, however, challenge this notion, as other evidence suggests that the expedition, if it had occurred, would have transpired substantially before Muhammad's birth.[1][50][51][52][53][47] Later Muslim scholars presumably linked Abraha's renowned name to the narrative of Muhammad's birth to elucidate the unclear passage about "the men of elephants" in Quran 105:1–5.[50][54] The Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity deems the tale of Abraha's war elephant expedition as a myth.[51]

    Muhammad's father, Abdullah, died almost six months before he was born.[55] Muhammad then stayed with his foster-mother, Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb, and her husband until he was two years old. At the age of six, Muhammad lost his biological mother Amina to illness and became an orphan.[56][57] For the next two years, until he was eight years old, Muhammad was under the guardianship of his paternal grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, until the latter's death. He then came under the care of his uncle, Abu Talib, the new leader of the Banu Hashim.[7] Abu Talib's brothers assisted with Muhammad's learning — Hamza, the youngest, trained Muhammad in archery, swordsmanship, and martial arts. Another uncle, Abbas, provided Muhammad with a job leading caravans on the northern segment of the route to Syria.[58]

    The historical record of Mecca during Muhammad's early life is limited and fragmentary, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and legend.[59] Several Islamic narratives relate that Muhammad, as a child, went on a trading trip to Syria with his uncle Abu Talib and met a monk named Bahira, who is said to have then foretold his prophethood.[60] There are multiple versions of the story with details that contradict each other.[61] All accounts of Bahira and his meeting with Muhammad have been considered fictitious by modern historians[62][63][64][65][66] as well as by some medieval Muslim scholars such as al-Dhahabi.[66]
